# TranslationSwap
This is a tool in python that will swap the english to japanese between two csv files using the matching korean as a key. 

Problem - 
One csv file has Korean to English 
One file has Korean to Japanese 
Both files give an ID that a game uses to know what value to show on the game UI 
However, The ID in the English file does not match what the game uses - the ID in the Japanese file is correct. 
So we need to swap the Japanese with the English using the Korean as the main key. 

How to make it work -
